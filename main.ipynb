    "This is a \"Jupyter notebook\", a tool for using Python interactively. For example, you can quickly work with data, run simulations, visualize data, etc. then decide you want to see how your results might change if you change a parameter earlier in your workflow. If you've used Mathematica before, the idea behind a Jupyter notebook is very similar. You hit `shift-enter` or `shift-return` to execute the code in a \"cell\". \n",
