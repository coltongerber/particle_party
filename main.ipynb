For example, you can quickly work with data, run simulations, visualize data, etc. then decide you want to see how your results might change if you change a parameter earlier in your workflow. If you've used Mathematica before, the idea behind a Jupyter notebook is very similar. You hit `shift-enter` or `shift-return` to execute the code in a \"cell\". \n",
